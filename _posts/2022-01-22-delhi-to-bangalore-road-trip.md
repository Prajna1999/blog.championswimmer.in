Arnav Gupta 😷 💉🟢 💉🟢 ([@championswimmer](https://twitter.com/championswimmer))

So I recently moved from [#Delhi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Delhi)  to [#Bangalore](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bangalore)  and the easiest and fastest way I could move my work desk setup (monitors, PC, gaming chair) and my car was to stuff all that into the 🚗 and drive it all the way down. 

So here's a smol thread 🧵 on a DEL-BLR road trip. [pic.twitter.com/CHIU2Ey63o](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453420393482440707/photo/1)

Day 1 was planned to be [#Delhi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Delhi)  to [#Gwalior](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gwalior) . But that would have left a very long 2nd day, so we planned to go a little further to Jhansi. 

A complete chance browsing through [@bookingcom](https://twitter.com/bookingcom) led us to discover this beautiful Bundelkhand Riverside Resort at Orchcha to stay. [pic.twitter.com/kKYFpbGAn1](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453420403158753282/photo/1)

Day 1 was 425 km. Total drive time was 10hrs+, because we stopped at Agra to visit [@TajMahal](https://twitter.com/TajMahal) too. 

Booked Hotel Atulyaa Taaj (apart from Oberoi Amarvilas, this is the nearest hotel to Taj) simply as an expensive parking spot 😅 as the car was loaded with stuff. [pic.twitter.com/vXZs8kooRh](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453421547536801795/photo/1)

The Bundelkhand Riverside Resort is the haveli of the erstwhile Raja of Orchcha, and imho, the best possible place one can do a highway stop on the first leg of this trip. Highly recommended! [pic.twitter.com/T4QaGiyTAh](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453422488906440705/photo/1)

Next day we went from Orchcha (Jhansi) to Nagpur. 

In terms of road quality, we faced the worst stretches on this leg. Places where the highway goes through a city and is pretty much a city road. Places under construction/repair. 

90% of it is still 100kmph level good. [pic.twitter.com/0QznI2K5iF](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453423182195478528/photo/1)

Day 2 was 550 kms of driving. And thus again 10hrs on the road. 

We stopped just a little before Nagpur inside the [@PenchMP](https://twitter.com/PenchMP) Tiger Reserve 🐯 to check out the resorts. 

Sadly post COVID, all are at very low/nil occupancy. But worth staying if you have 2 spare days in the trip. [pic.twitter.com/VxfRPe1LbW](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453424234277998592/photo/1)

There's a lot of stretch of the National Highway that cuts through the tiger reserve. Despite tall barricades along the roads, monkeys on the road are a common feature. 

We had to get out of Pench post sundown and it was spine-chillingly eerie to drive through the unlit jungle. [pic.twitter.com/ABd5ufNLyG](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453425190600249344/photo/1)

Next day we drove down to [#Hyderabad](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hyderabad)  

This was quite a beauty of a drive. The amount of greenery, hills, valleys, small river crossings we saw around will be unparalleled. Great roads too, the whole stretch. [pic.twitter.com/mJBq3ACbvn](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453521160767881227/photo/1)

Not gonna lie, Hyderabad stop was all about [@IKEA](https://twitter.com/IKEA) pilgrimage. 

First time visit to IKEA, and totalllly worth it! Bought a bunch of things, and noted down a bunch more to order. 

Protip: Good place to take out someone too 😅, won't run out of conversation starters. [pic.twitter.com/YVQwbPsTxr](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453522567730380806/photo/1)

Day 3 was 500km, and we didn't stop at all (had to hurry to reach before IKEA closes) so covered it all in 8 hrs. 

The last 50km stretch, the bypass around Hyderabad and the road to HiTech city were just 👨‍🍳🤌

Easily 150kph capable roads, 4 lanes throughout,  well maintained! [pic.twitter.com/FRoxTIBlH6](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453523992619327489/photo/1)

At every stop I tried to stay at a good hotel, primarily because I wanted the car, laden to the brim with my stuff, to be parked properly.

[@Westin](https://twitter.com/Westin) at Hyderabad has one of the best breakfast buffet spreads, I figured, as a result. Definitely recommended just for the breakfast. [pic.twitter.com/FejoZzqVZR](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453577024581169161/photo/1)

Final leg - home run. Compared to the last 2 legs, where there would often be 30-40 min stretches of driving through literally middle of nowhere (no dhabas, no small towns, no civilisation), this whole leg is through quite populated areas. Not a single deserted stretch. [pic.twitter.com/hVO6mXmAFa](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453578154006564867/photo/1)

Day 4: Another 525 km. 

Stopped at IKEA again in the morning 😅
Also stopped at [@Lenskart_com](https://twitter.com/Lenskart_com) as driving with the sun in the eye was starting to get to me. Buying shades helped a lot, albeit only on the last day. 

Reached [@peakbengaluru](https://twitter.com/peakbengaluru) quite late into the night. [pic.twitter.com/84jquNrgbM](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1453579026216280065/photo/1)

Thankfully journey ended at Indiranagar and didn't need to go upto [@SonyWorldJn](https://twitter.com/SonyWorldJn), or else would have had taken another 4 days to cross the stretch of deleted road at Koramangala😅😅
