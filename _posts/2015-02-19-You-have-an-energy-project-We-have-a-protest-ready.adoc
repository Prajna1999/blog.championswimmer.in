The Govt. vs Priya Pillai case brings to light to nicely rounded nexus of NGOs with large US/EU corporate giants. They fund NGOs like Greenpeace to engineer protests in developing nations so that energy projects do not take off, so that these countries remain dependent on imported energy from the very same corporations.
It’s funny how people often do not understand sovereignty and freedom of speech are equally important. And anyway, the government is not stopping anyone from staging protests in India, so freedom of speech is never being curtailed. Rallying foreign support for such engineered protests is an attack on the country’s sovereignty, and the state has a right to stop it from happening. But wag a few dollars in front of your nose, and everyone recites the NGO line. Sad state of affairs.
